# retropie-collection-avgn
  
Emulation Station collections based on the games played and mentioned in the Angry Video Game Nerd series, from the [Cinemassacre](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0M0rxSz3IF0CsSour1iWmw) channel on Youtube.

I started bulding these for myself and decided to share it with the community. Every season has two lists: 
* custom-AVGN Season X - Bad games.cfg  
The bad games actually played

* custom-AVGN Season X - All.cfg  
All the games shown/mentioned (just in case you want to play good games also).

This is a work in progress and I just finished the first season's list. Some games are missing because I don't collect certain consoles games (like GBA, PSP, PS2 and so on). Feel free to make pull requests adding those.

Place these files in the `/home/pi/.emulationstation/collections` (or equivalent) directory. [This script](https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/17783) may help you fixing the rom filenames from my list to match the ones in yours.
